                    Tourism or tourist trips - departures or tourist trips - departures (travel) of visitors to another country or area.
                    Modern tourism is impossible without activities for the production of a tourist product:
                    special clothing, equipment, hotels, excursion bureaus, transport, etc.
                    However, in the currently proposed definitions, this activity is not reflected.
                    Tourism as a specific form of activity has emerged relatively recently, but its roots go back to ancient times.
